# MNIST-DIGIT-classification000_using_ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORK
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.
Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. 
An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it. The "signal" at a connection is a real number, 
and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. 
Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. 
Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. 
Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), 
to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
